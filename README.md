# Auto-Fill-Details-Chrome-Extension

a browser plugin (Chrome & Edge or any Chromium based broswer) that automatically fills in online forms for multiple people, e.g. There is form that requires a lot of information to be filled out again and again with slight variations or information to be filled out on multiple platforms with the same information.
Relevant information includes name, surname, birthday date, mail address, passcode, etc
Data for these people can be stored beforehand, e.g. in a text file or the browser extension itself.
This extension then allow the users to fill out online forms for multiple people in a very short time window, e.g. for visa applications.

This works more like Chrome own personal information system but this is extended version of that.
